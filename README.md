# nasa-cmip6-temporal-downscaling-daily2hourly

### About This Repository

> **Note:** This repository documents and centralizes **my personal contributions** to a larger team-based project involving **6 collaborators**. The project explored various techniques for temporal downscaling of NASA CMIP6 climate simulations, with a particular focus on **statistical methods**, **machine learning (ML)**, and **hybrid approaches**.

While the full project scope extends beyond the contents of this repository—and includes components subject to a **corporate problem statement under a signed Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA)**—everything presented here is:

-  **Open source**
-  **Rooted in academic research**
-  **Free from any commercial intent**
-  Intended solely for **educational and knowledge-sharing purposes**

The data, code, models, and research references in this repository are part of my **individual academic journey** and are shared to contribute to the broader scientific and open-source communities.

Feel free to explore, fork, or contribute — and please cite appropriately if you build on this work.
